# unit-4-game

* This is a game in which you must, using the three crystals, match your number on the left with the computer's number on the right.

* Each crystal has a random, hidden value.

* When you click on a crystal, its value will be added to the number on the left.

* If you can MATCH the computer's number on the right, you WIN and the game starts over.

* If you go OVER the computer's number, you LOSE and you will have to try again.

* See how many times you can out-smart the computer!
